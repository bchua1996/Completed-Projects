# 2. Spotify Analysis
Constructed statistical models tailored specifically to music companies to facilitate business decisions given certain scenarios. Dataset obtained from Kaggle. The different scenarios are briefly described below: 

- MUSIC FESTIVAL - Our label is sponsoring a music festival and we are trying to decide which genre to invite to perform. 

- INTRODUCING MORE LIVE SONG VERSION - Many of our artists have expressed interest in releasing live versions of their most popular songs, and we are wondering if having a higher liveness leads to above average popularity. 

- FACTORS OF POPULARITY - As a music label, we see that times are changing and itâ€™s important to stay on top of current trends. We are very interested in identifying the factors that influence the popularity of songs. We believe that popularity is the most valuable KPI, and it is the most directly related to revenue.
